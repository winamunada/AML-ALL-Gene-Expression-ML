# EVALUATING ML MODELS FOR GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS IN AML AND ALL CANCER

This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression data to distinguish between Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Accurate classification and clustering of gene expression profiles can provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of these cancers and aid in developing targeted therapies.

# Algorithms Used:

## Classification:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
- Decision Tree: A tree-structured classifier that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.
- Random Forest (RF): An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- Logistic Regression: A statistical model used for binary classification, providing probability estimates for class membership.
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes in the feature space.

## Clustering:
- K-Means: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on feature similarity.
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): A probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, allowing for more flexible cluster shapes.
